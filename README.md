üå§Ô∏è **Weather Insights: A Multi-City Analysis Dashboard**
A dynamic, interactive data visualization tool built in Power BI to explore real-time weather conditions, air quality, and forecasts across major Indian cities.

**Short Description / Purpose**
The Weather Insights Dashboard is a visually engaging and analytical Power BI report designed to help users explore and compare live weather data from multiple cities in a single, unified view. The dashboard focuses on highlighting key environmental metrics like temperature, air quality, humidity, and 7-day forecasts. This tool is intended for anyone interested in environmental data, travel planning, or simply tracking weather patterns across different regions.

**Tech Stack**
The dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies:

üìä Power BI Desktop ‚Äì Main data visualization platform used for report creation.

üìÇ Power Query ‚Äì Used for data transformation, cleaning, and integration from the data source.

üß† DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) ‚Äì Used for creating measures like the color-coded AQI conditions and other dynamic calculations.

üìù Data Modeling ‚Äì A relational model was established to enable cross-filtering of all visuals by the selected city.

üìÅ File Format ‚Äì .pbix for development and .jpg for dashboard previews.

**Data Source**
The data is sourced from a real-time weather API, providing live data on ~6 major cities in India, including details on their location, temperature, air quality, and forecasts.

**Features / Highlights**
Problem: Comparing real-time weather and environmental conditions across different cities often requires checking multiple sources or apps. There is a lack of a single, intuitive interface to see both the current weather and critical air quality data side-by-side.

**Goal of the Dashboard**: To deliver an interactive visual tool that:

Enables users to explore and compare live weather data for cities like Pune, Mumbai, Kolkata, and Hyderabad.

Provides immediate, actionable insights into air quality and forecasts.

Uncovers trends in temperature, precipitation, and pollution levels.

**Walkthrough of Key Visuals**

Main Weather Panel (Top Left): Displays the current temperature, weather condition (e.g., Mist), and the last updated time for the selected city.

Multi-City Slicer: An interactive filter allows users to switch between Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Jaipur, Kolkata, Pune, and Mumbai, updating all visuals on the dashboard.

Key Metric Cards: Individual cards provide at-a-glance information for Humidity, Wind Speed, Visibility, Pressure, UV Index, and Precipitation.

Air Quality Index (AQI) Gauge: A dynamic gauge provides a color-coded assessment of air quality (e.g., Green for "Good," Orange for "Unhealthy"). It also shows a breakdown of pollutants like PM10, CO, O3, and NO2.

Forecast Weather (Line Chart): A line chart displays the temperature trend for the upcoming seven days.

Chance of Rain (Bar Chart): A horizontal bar chart uses data bars to intuitively represent the probability of rain for the next week.

**Impact & Insights**

Health & Wellness: Users can make informed decisions based on the AQI, such as avoiding outdoor activities during periods of high pollution.

Travel Planning: Tourists and commuters can quickly check and compare weather forecasts and conditions across multiple cities.

Environmental Monitoring: The dashboard serves as a simple tool for observing and comparing environmental metrics in different urban areas.
